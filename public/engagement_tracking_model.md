\*\*Three-tier engagement mode\*\*\*\*Tier 1 - Presence (cheap, weak signal)\*\*Examples:\- - App open    - Page visible    - Tab in foregroundWhy it's weak:\- - Can be gamed by leaving a tab open    - Correlates poorly with outcomes\*\*Use case:\*\*Context only. Never KPI-grade on this.\*\*Tier 2 - Interaction (good signal)\*\*Examples:\- - Scrolling meaningful content    - Clicking job listings    - Navigating between sections    - Typing (search, answers, forms)    - Media playback with periodic checksThis is where \_most apps stop\_. You shouldn't.\*\*Still vulnerable\*\*:\- - Mindless clicking    - Automation    - Low cognitive effort\*\*Tier 3 - Cognitive / Task-Progress Engagement (strong signal)\*\*This is your unfair advantage.Examples:\- - Answering interview questions    - Completing structured steps (resume upload, job application stages)    - Revising answers    - Completing coaching-recommended actions    - Reaching defined task milestonesThese are \*\*hard to fake at scale\*\* and strongly correlated with outcomes.\*\*How to compute "engagement time" correctly\*\*\*\*Step 1: Define \_eligible engagement events\_\*\*Only these events can accrue time:\- - Active typing (with debounce)    - Voice input recording    - Structured task progression    - Confirmed playback with interaction pings    - Explicit task completion stepsScrolling alone should \_not\_ accrue time unless paired with:\- - dwell thresholds    - content depth markers\*\*Step 2: Use heartbeat-based accumulation\*\*Instead of:session\_start → session\_endUse:rolling engagement windowsExample logic (conceptual):\- - When an eligible event occurs, open an engagement window    - Continue accruing time while:      - events occur within N seconds      - the app is visible    - Close the window after inactivity threshold (e.g., 30-60s)This makes:\- - idle tabs worthless    - background apps irrelevant    - automation harder\*\*Step 3: Weight time by activity type\*\*Not all engagement minutes are equal.Example weighting (illustrative, not prescriptive):\- - Interview practice: high weight    - Job application completion: high weight    - Resume editing: medium-high    - Browsing listings: medium    - Passive reading: lowYou still report \_time\_, but internally you also have:\- - \*\*Effective Engagement Minutes (EEM)\*\*This maps far better to outcomes.\*\*Anti-gaming protections (critical)\*\*\*\*1\\. Inactivity decay\*\*If no qualifying action occurs within X seconds:\- - stop the clock    - do not retroactively resume\*\*2\\. Action entropy checks\*\*If the same trivial action repeats unnaturally:\- - stop counting time    - flag as low-quality engagementThis catches scripts and mindless clicking.\*\*3\\. Foreground + interaction requirement\*\*Time only counts if:\- - app is foregrounded    - AND interaction continues\*\*4\\. Cap per activity\*\*Daily caps prevent:\- - time farming    - overnight exploitation    - obsessive overcountingCaps are \_protective\_, not punitive.\*\*Engagement Event Taxonomy \& Accrual Rules\*\*\*\*1\\. Canonical Definitions (lock these in)\*\*Before events, we define terms. These definitions matter more than the schema.\*\*Presence\*\*The app is \_eligible\_ to record engagement.\- App is in foreground\- Page/tab is visible\- User is authenticated (or identified at member level)Presence alone \*\*never accrues time\*\*.\*\*Interaction\*\*The user is providing \*\*ongoing motor input\*\* that indicates attention.\- Scrolls\- Clicks\- Typing\- Navigation\- Media controlsInteraction \*\*keeps windows alive\*\*, but does not guarantee time accrual.\*\*Task Engagement\*\*The user is performing a \*\*job-seeking or interview-preparation activity\*\* with plausible outcome relevance.Only \*\*Task Engagement\*\* accrues \_Verified Engagement Time\_.\*\*Engagement Window\*\*A bounded time interval during which:\- Presence = true\- Interaction is occurring within thresholds\- A qualifying task is activeWindows open, extend, and close dynamically.\*\*2\\. Tier 1 - Presence Events (Gatekeepers)\*\*These events establish eligibility.They are \*\*necessary but never sufficient\*\*.\*\*Required Presence Events\*\*| \*\*Event\*\* | \*\*Trigger\*\* | \*\*Notes\*\* || --- | --- | --- || app\_foregrounded | App/tab gains focus | Reset inactivity timers || app\_backgrounded | App/tab loses focus | Immediately pause accrual || page\_visibility\_visible | Page becomes visible | Required for web || page\_visibility\_hidden | Page hidden | Pause accrual || session\_start | App session begins | Metadata only || session\_end | App session ends | Metadata only |\*\*Rules\*\*\- Presence must be continuously true for any engagement time to accrue\- Presence loss immediately pauses all engagement windows\*\*Why this exists\*\*\- Prevents background inflation\- Enables defensible claims like:"We only count engagement when the app is actively in use."\*\*3\\. Tier 2 - Interaction Events (Qualifiers)\*\*These events indicate \*\*ongoing attention\*\*.\*\*Eligible Interaction Events\*\*| \*\*Event\*\* | \*\*Trigger\*\* | \*\*Debounce\*\* || --- | --- | --- || scroll\_depth\_change | Scroll passes meaningful threshold | ≥300ms || navigation\_click | Click to new section/view | Immediate || typing\_activity | Keyboard input | Debounced (e.g., 1s) || search\_action | Job or content search | Immediate || media\_control | Play / pause / seek | Immediate || form\_interaction | Field focus/change | Debounced |\*\*Rules\*\*\- Interaction must occur at least once every \*\*N seconds\*\* (e.g., 30-60s) to keep an engagement window open\- Repetitive low-entropy actions (e.g., rapid identical clicks) do \*\*not\*\* extend windows indefinitely\*\*Anti-gaming guardrails\*\*\- Action entropy checks (same action repeated unnaturally → stop extending)\- Scroll-only interaction does \_not\_ qualify unless paired with dwell or task context\*\*Why this exists\*\*\- Filters idle presence\- Supports heartbeat logic\- Provides continuity between task actions\*\*4\\. Tier 3 - Task Engagement Events (Accrual Drivers)\*\*These are the \*\*only events that accrue Verified Engagement Time\*\*.\*\*Canonical Task Categories\*\*\*\*A. Interview Coach Tasks (High Weight)\*\*| \*\*Event\*\* | \*\*Trigger\*\* || --- | --- || interview\_question\_started | Question presented || interview\_response\_started | User begins answering || interview\_response\_completed | Answer submitted || interview\_response\_revised | Answer edited/redone || coaching\_action\_completed | Suggested action followed |These events:\- open engagement windows\- extend windows when paired with interaction\- accrue time at highest weight\*\*B. Job-Seeking Tasks (High-Medium Weight)\*\*| \*\*Event\*\* | \*\*Trigger\*\* || --- | --- || job\_search\_executed | Search submitted || job\_listing\_viewed | Listing opened || job\_application\_started | Application initiated || job\_application\_step\_completed | Step completed || job\_application\_submitted | Application submitted |Accrual continues only while interaction persists.\*\*C. Profile / Resume Tasks (Medium Weight)\*\*| \*\*Event\*\* | \*\*Trigger\*\* || --- | --- || resume\_upload | Resume uploaded || resume\_edit\_started | Editing begins || resume\_edit\_completed | Edit saved || profile\_update\_completed | Profile change saved |\*\*D. Passive Content Tasks (Low Weight, Conditional)\*\*| \*\*Event\*\* | \*\*Trigger\*\* || --- | --- || content\_view\_started | Article/video opened || content\_view\_progress | Progress checkpoint || content\_view\_completed | End reached |Rules:\- Accrues time \*\*only if\*\* paired with interaction (scroll, pause, seek)\- No interaction → no accrual\*\*5\\. Engagement Window Logic (the core engine)\*\*\*\*Opening a Window\*\*An engagement window opens when:\- Presence = true\- A Tier 3 task event occurs\*\*Extending a Window\*\*A window remains open while:\- Presence remains true\- Interaction events occur within threshold\- No inactivity timeout is exceeded\*\*Closing a Window\*\*A window closes when:\- Presence is lost (immediate)\- Inactivity exceeds threshold (e.g., 60s)\- Task context ends and no new task begins\*\*Accrual Rule (non-negotiable)\*\*\*\*Time is accrued only while an engagement window is open.\*\*No retroactive accrual.No grace periods.\*\*6\\. Time Weighting (internal, not user-facing)\*\*You may internally compute:\- Raw engagement minutes\- Weighted engagement minutes (Effective Engagement Minutes)Example (illustrative only):\- Interview practice: 1.0×\- Job applications: 0.9×\- Resume editing: 0.7×\- Passive content: 0.3×Externally (to MCOs), you report:\- \*\*Verified Engagement Time\*\*\- Optionally, \*\*Engagement by Activity Category\*\*Never expose weights to end users.\*\*7\\. Hard Caps \& Decay (protective constraints)\*\*\*\*Daily Caps\*\*\- Prevent overnight farming\- Prevent runaway accumulation\- Preserve signal qualityCaps should be generous and invisible.\*\*Inactivity Decay\*\*\- No qualifying interaction → immediate pause\- No catch-up accrual\*\*8\\. What Not to Track (Explicitly Forbidden)\*\*Do not create events for:\- Mouse movement\- Keystroke logging (privacy risk)\- Window focus polling loops\- Artificial "still there?" pings\- Time-only heartbeats without actionThese weaken trust and invite compliance issues.\*\*9\\. Reporting Guarantees You Can Make to MCOs\*\*Because of this taxonomy, you can defensibly state:\- Engagement time reflects \*\*verified, task-based activity\*\*\- Idle or background time is excluded\- Metrics are resistant to casual gaming\- Engagement correlates meaningfully with outcomes\- Privacy is respected (no surveillance inference)That combination is rare.\*\*10\\. Final Mental Model (worth repeating)\*\*\- Tier 1 says: \_"Could engagement exist?"\_\- Tier 2 says: \_"Is attention plausibly present?"\_\- Tier 3 says: \_"Is the user doing something that matters?"\_Only when all three agree does time become real.
